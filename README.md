# Globular-MVC
Globular-MVC is a framework designed to facilitate the rapid creation of web applications using Globular, a backend framework built around gRPC. Following the Model View Control Pattern, like most frontend frameworks, Globular-MVC contains all the essential code to streamline web application development without the need to reinvent the wheel. All graphical user interface elements are [web-components](/components/README.md), allowing seamless reuse in your projects, even if you opt not to use Globular as your backend.
